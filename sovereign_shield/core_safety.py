"""
CoreSafety - Immutable Security Constitution
=============================================
Provides tamper-proof security laws enforced via OS-level hardware memory
protection (mprotect/VirtualProtect), SHA-256 hash integrity verification,
and a comprehensive action auditing pipeline.

Security Properties:
    - Security constants are frozen into OS read-only memory pages.
      Any write attempt (Python, ctypes, C extensions) triggers an
      immediate hardware fault (SIGSEGV / ACCESS_VIOLATION).
    - Source file hash is stored in hardware-protected memory — no
      writable lockfile, no cache dictionary to poison.
    - Every action passes through a multi-layer audit before execution.
    - Thread-safe state management via locks.

AEGIS Assessment Remediation (v2.4.1):
    - Finding 1: type.__setattr__ bypass → DEFEATED by hardware memory pages.
    - Finding 2: _STATE cache poisoning  → DEFEATED by eliminating the cache.
    - Finding 3: _SELF_HASH overwrite    → DEFEATED by hardware memory pages.
    - Finding 4: Lockfile overwrite       → DEFEATED by removing the lockfile.
    - Finding 5: Function replacement    → DEFEATED by closure encapsulation.
