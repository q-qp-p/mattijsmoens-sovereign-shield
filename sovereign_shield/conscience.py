Conscience - Ethical Evaluation Engine
======================================
Provides immutable ethical directives enforced via the FrozenNamespace metaclass,
deception detection, harm reduction, and intellectual property protection.

All evaluation patterns are pre-compiled at module load time for performance.

As of v2.4.1, the module's integrity seal is stored in OS-level
hardware-protected memory (via mprotect/VirtualProtect) — no writable
lockfile on disk. The seal is re-verified on every evaluate_action() call.
